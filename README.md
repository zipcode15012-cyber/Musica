Musica is a lightweight, customizable music library app designed for people who want full control over their listening experience. You can upload songs directly from your device using local files or add tracks through supported embed links, giving you the freedom to build your library however you like. Once your music is in, Musica works completely offline, letting you listen anywhere without relying on an internet connection or external services.

Beyond simple playback, Musica helps you stay organized and engaged with your music. You can sort songs into playlists, track your most‑played tracks, and view personalized listening stats that evolve with your habits. And because customization is at the heart of the app, you can tailor the interface, themes, and overall look to match your style. Musica isn’t just a player — it’s your personal music space, built the way you want it.
